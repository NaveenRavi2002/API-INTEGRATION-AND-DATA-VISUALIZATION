# 🧠 Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning and Visualization Dashboard

This project is a **final-year Data Science project** focused on predicting diseases based on user-selected symptoms. It uses a **Machine Learning model** trained on symptom-disease data and is deployed as a **Streamlit web application**.

The project also includes a **visual analytics dashboard** developed using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to help visualize symptom distributions and their interrelations.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- ✅ Develop a Machine Learning model that predicts the most probable disease based on symptoms.
- ✅ Create a web-based dashboard using Streamlit for user interaction.
- ✅ Integrate **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** visualizations to analyze and display symptom patterns, frequencies, and relationships.

---

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. ✅ Python Script (`disease_prediction_app.py`)
- Streamlit application with ML-based prediction logic.
- User interface for selecting symptoms and displaying predicted disease.
- Embedded plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### 2. ✅ Visualization Dashboard
- **Matplotlib Bar Chart**: Displays symptom frequency.
- **Seaborn Heatmap**: Displays correlation among symptoms.
- *(Optional)* Additional charts based on dataset (pie chart, line chart, etc.).

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included

- 📊 **Symptom Frequency Bar Chart** (Matplotlib)
- 🔥 **Symptom Correlation Heatmap** (Seaborn)
- 📋 *(Optional)* Other EDA plots like symptom occurrence distribution

These visualizations help in understanding:
- Which symptoms are most common
- How symptoms are related to each other
- The overall structure of the dataset

## 💡 Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Streamlit** – For web app interface  
- **Scikit-learn** – For training the ML model  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – For data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – For bar charts and basic plotting  
- **Seaborn** – For heatmaps and advanced visualization  
- **Joblib** – For model serialization  

---

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project

1. **Install required packages:**

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
